# NTSC - Never Twice The Same Credits
Code for my video/code experiment "NTSC - Never Twice The Same Credits”, a different title sequence every time you watch it!

## THE IDEA
I’m kind of addicted to TV Series and love Title Sequences. And as I was experimenting with code, I was wondering if it would be possible to create a Title Sequence that would change every time you watch a new episode. That’s how I came up with this idea.

## THE CODE
I use the p5js library to make this work: https://github.com/processing/p5.js

You will find all the code I used to create this experiment in the 3 js files attached to this repository.

## BEHIND THE SCENES
If you'd like to knwow more about my process, I wrote an article on [Medium](https://medium.com)
