# NTSC - Never Twice The Same Credits
Code for my video/code experiment "NTSC - Never Twice The Same Credits”, a different title sequence every time you watch it!

## THE IDEA
I’m kind of addicted to TV Series and love Title Sequences. And as I was experimenting with code, I was wondering if it would be possible to create a Title Sequence that would change every time you watch a new episode. That’s how I came up with this idea.

## THE EXPERIMENT

**You can watch this experiment here: [https://xp.arnofaure.com/NTSC/never-twice-the-same-credits.html](https://xp.arnofaure.com/NTSC/never-twice-the-same-credits.html) **

## THE CODE
I used the [p5.js library](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) and the [p5.scribbles.js library](https://github.com/generative-light/p5.scribble.js) to make this work

You will find all the code I used to create this experiment in the 2 js files attached to this repository.

## BEHIND THE SCENES
If you'd like to knwow more about my process, I wrote an article on [Medium](http://bit.ly/nora-ntsc)
